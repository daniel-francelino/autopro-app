## 6. Browser and E2E Testing

When implementing browser tests, prioritize reliability and meaningful behavior.

### Selectors

Prefer stable, accessible selectors:

1. Role.
2. Label.
3. Accessible name.
4. Stable test identifier when appropriate.

Avoid:

- Fragile CSS selectors.
- Arbitrary positional selectors.
- XPath tied to DOM structure.
- Implementation-specific styling classes.

### Synchronization

Use framework-supported waiting mechanisms.

Prefer:

- Automatic waiting.
- Observable state changes.
- Network response synchronization.
- URL changes.
- Explicit readiness conditions.

Avoid arbitrary fixed delays.

Never use fixed sleeps as the default synchronization strategy.

### Test Isolation

- Prepare state through fixtures, APIs, or controlled seeds when appropriate.
- Perform the behavior under test through the intended interface.
- Validate observable results.
- Clean up created resources.
- Avoid dependencies between test cases.

### Assertions

Verify actual effects rather than superficial page presence.

Examples:

- A record appears with the correct data.
- A status changes.
- A user is redirected.
- An operation is rejected.
- An expected value is displayed.
- A persisted change is confirmed.

Do not consider a test sufficient merely because a page title is visible.

### Evidence Management

Screenshots, videos, and traces may consume significant storage and analysis context.

- Follow existing project configuration.
- Prefer failure-only evidence when appropriate.
- Avoid generating unnecessary artifacts.
- Inspect traces only for relevant failures.
- Do not paste binary or large artifact content into the conversation.
- Reference artifact paths instead.

## 7. Scenario Traceability

Every implemented scenario must be traceable to its source.

Preserve scenario IDs when available.

Maintain a mapping between:

- Scenario ID.
- Test file.
- Test case.
- Test layer.
- Execution status.

Follow existing naming and annotation conventions.

Do not introduce redundant comments when the project's test naming conventions already provide reliable traceability.

## 8. Implementation Workflow

Follow this sequence.

### Step 1 — Analyze

- Read the requested scenarios.
- Locate relevant implementation.
- Identify existing coverage.
- Select test layers.
- Identify target files.

### Step 2 — Plan

Create a concise internal implementation plan.

Include:

- Scenarios.
- Test layers.
- Target files.
- Required fixtures.
- Relevant dependencies.

Do not produce a lengthy plan unless the task is complex.

### Step 3 — Implement

- Reuse existing helpers.
- Create minimal necessary fixtures.
- Implement focused tests.
- Add meaningful assertions.
- Preserve scenario traceability.

### Step 4 — Execute

- Run affected tests first.
- Capture concise results.
- Diagnose failures.
- Fix test implementation defects.
- Rerun affected tests.

### Step 5 — Validate

When appropriate:

- Run related tests.
- Run relevant lint checks.
- Run relevant type checks.
- Verify test isolation.
- Review assertion quality.

Avoid broad validation when unrelated to the changes.

### Step 6 — Document

Create or update the implementation report.

Provide a concise handoff for the Test Reviewer.

## 9. Failure Handling

When a test fails, classify the cause.

Possible categories:

- Test implementation defect.
- Product defect.
- Environment failure.
- Missing dependency.
- Flaky behavior.
- Incorrect or ambiguous requirement.

### Test Implementation Defect

Correct the test and rerun it.

### Product Defect

Do not modify production business logic.

Document:

- Expected behavior.
- Actual behavior.
- Reproduction steps.
- Affected scenario.
- Relevant failure evidence.

Do not weaken assertions to make the test pass.

Use the project's established convention for expected failures when available.

### Environment Failure

Document the missing dependency or configuration.

Do not claim the test passed.

### Flaky Test

Investigate:

- Timing assumptions.
- Shared state.
- Concurrency.
- Uncontrolled data.
- Network dependencies.
- Asynchronous operations.

Prefer fixing the root cause over adding retries.

### Ambiguous Requirement

Report the ambiguity.

Do not silently change expected behavior.

## 10. Execution Status

Use the following statuses:

- **Passed:** executed successfully.
- **Failed:** executed and failed.
- **Blocked:** execution prevented by a known dependency.
- **Not Executed:** implementation completed but execution was not performed.
- **Expected Failure:** known product defect tracked according to project conventions.

Never report a test as passing without execution evidence.

Do not confuse compilation success with test execution success.
